Data Stucture and Algorithms

Implemented all the linear strcutures with Java at first, but turned to C when it comes to linked list for two reasons:

- Practice C pointers and memory management in the real world, to build a relatively solid fundation for CSAPP learning.
- The C programming language is much more lower and near the machine, so it may be better to grasp the idea of data structures and the trade-offs between different algorithms.

This repo may include the following contents according to my current plan:

- All basic data structures implemented by C and with several test cases for each one;
- Algorithm tatics such as recursion, dynamic programming and so on;
- Leetcode solutions along the learning journey and afterwards;
- GNU makefile / gdb / some C programming pitfalls and skills;
- Other miscellaneous things.

This repo is for my own learning and record, so it may be messy and not well-organized.

And welcome to any suggestions and corrections, I'll be very appreciated.
