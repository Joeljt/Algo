## Data Stucture and Algorithms

This is a whole new around of algorithm learning, I'm planning to implement all data structures with Go this time fot two reasons:

1. Familirize myself with the Go programming language.
2. Make myself comfortable with algorithms again after near a year.

I expect this round of learning and implementing easier and smoother than before, for I had done it several times before.
Also, I should be taking advantage of this round to practice my English writing skills as well.
